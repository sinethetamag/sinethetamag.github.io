		<p>Your tongue stings with raw lemon, sherbert, salt-and-vinegar chips, leaving an acidic taste behind. “SOUR 酸” chronicles sourness and its multiplicities—a look into candy that fizzles before turning sweet, into relationships that spark and burn and fester into resentment. Dig into flavor and feeling, into work that tingles the senses and burns holes in its wake.</p>
