		<p><b>The deadline for submitting to our 2021 summer writing competition has passed. The contest will return again in 2022. The information below remains as an archive.</b></p>

		<p>Our upcoming sinθ #20 marks another year of Sine Theta! To celebrate, we are bringing back our summer writing competition for its third iteration. We are delighted to announce RF Kuang (author of <i>THE POPPY WARS</i> trilogy) as this year’s Fiction judge and Chen Chen (author of National Book Award-longlisted <i>WHEN I GROW UP I WANT TO BE A LIST OF FURTHER POSSIBILITIES</i>) as this year’s Poetry judge.</p>

		<p>Submit by <b>June 27th</b> for a chance to be published in sinθ #20 and receive feedback from established writers! <b>First place in each category will receive a $50 USD cash prize.</b></p> 

		<p>We’re accepting entries for both fiction (prose) and poetry. We invite you to reflect on the following three prompts as inspiration for your pieces. You may reflect on the prompts separately or as a collective, drawing themes and ideas that resonate with you. Entries <b>must</b> engage with the prompt(s), but can do so either directly or indirectly. You may only submit one entry per category, so send us your best work!</p>
