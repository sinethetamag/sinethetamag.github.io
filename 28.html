		<p>亡國之音 。。。A splash of sound, blooming, echoing; a piercing cry, disruptive; death knell of a nation.</p> 


		<p>Submissions to Sine Theta Magazine's 28th issue, themed “SOUND 音,” are officially open! Thanks to our <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.patreon.com/sinetheta">Patreon subscribers</a>, Sine Theta Magazine is a paying publication—all contributors will be paid $10 USD per piece.</p>


		<p>Somewhere, an orchestra is tuning. Silence is broken by a single suspended note slowly building into layers of instruments, hearing and finding each other and then—fading again. Ready to launch into an odyssey of sound. “SOUND 音” calls for work that swells and resonates. We want to capture a sonic landscape in words by unpicking language and music, exploring oral history and signals in the static. The arpeggios in your head, the glottal consonants caught in your mouth, the odes passed across generations.</p> 


		<p>Submissions are due <b>THURSDAY, 13 JULY, at 11:59 PM PST</b> to <a href = "mailto:sinethetamag@gmail.com">sinethetamag@gmail.com</a> for full consideration of your work(s). Visit our <a href = "submit.html">submissions guidelines</a> for more details. Feel free to DM or email us with any questions you may have; we welcome pitches sent ahead of the deadline!</p>
