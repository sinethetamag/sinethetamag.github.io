		<p>Somewhere, an orchestra is tuning. Silence is broken by a single suspended note slowly building into layers of instruments, hearing and finding each other and then—fading again. Ready to launch into an odyssey of sound. “SOUND 音” swells and resonates into a rich sonic landscape, signals in the static.</p> 

		<p>This issue features the winners of our <a href = "contest.html">fifth annual writing contest</a>! We are grateful to Ching-In Chen for serving as our poetry judge and Lan Samantha Chang for serving as our fiction judge this year.</p>
