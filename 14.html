	<p>SINθ MAGAZINE ISSUE #14 “PERFUME (香)“ IS OUT NOW!</p>

	<p>Which are the aromas coaxing you to sleep at night? Which are the whiffs you track to a fight? Which are the trails you follow home?</p>

	<p>Scents are often treated as slippery, effervescent—clouded gates to locked memories and the stuff polluting forgotten nightmares. Yet, in the midst of their poetic gauze, they can still be numbing and inundating. Sine Theta Magazine is pleased to introduce Issue #14 “PERFUME 香”: a heady, electrifying compendium of evocative artwork, steely poetry, and thoughtful conversation.</p>

	<p>In this 43-paged issue:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Editor-in-chief Jiaqi Kang tackles some household chores before succumbing to a tangentially-absurdist whim at the behest of her younger brother</li>
	<li>Art director Elisabeth Siegel converses with performance artist Patty Chang, discussing Chang’s recent project involving ablution of a beached whale and her past work in China with minoritized figures and communities</li>
	<li>A selection of poetry wrangling with different iterations of “perfume,” ranging from intoxicating coitus in “Bosque” by S. Qiouyi Lu to flatulence in “Flatulence” by paul aster stone-tsao</li>
	<li>Works centering familial memory, veneration, and generational longing by Kwan Ann Tan and Shu-Ling Chua</li>
	<li>Atmospheric photo series by Kimberly Kiong and Kevin Lim</li>
	<li>Visual and digital artwork by Liz Zhang and Taylor Wang</li>
	<li>Conversation between sinθ staff members about gatekeeping, class privilege, ethnic enclaves, and the digital boom’s impact on the possibility of a global Sino diasporic community</li>
	</ul>
