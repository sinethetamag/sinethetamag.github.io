		<p>Sine Theta Magazine is looking to expand its editorial team!</p>

		<p><i>Please note that all of these roles are volunteer</i> — at this time, none of the magazine’s staff are paid. These roles are not meant to substitute paid jobs. All levels of staff work unpaid on the magazine as a passion project alongside their other responsibilities. Nonetheless, applicants will ideally seek to prioritize Sine Theta as an important commitment.</p>

		<p>We are looking for:</p>

		<p><b>Print design intern</b> (estimated 8 hours per week during design production; workload fluctuates over a 3-month cycle depending on editorial schedule)</p>
		<p><b>Duties include:</b></p>
		<ul>
		<li>Use Adobe InDesign (and other supplemental Adobe Suite software as needed) to participate in the design process of each quarterly print issue, laying out pages in creative ways that reflect the spirit and ‘vibe’ of short stories, poetry, and nonfiction features included in the magazine. The use of generative AI (e.g. DALL-E, Midjourney) is not allowed.</li>
		<li>Provide graphic design support as needed for promotional material (e.g. posters, social media graphics, etc.).</li>
		<li>Design samples from previous issues may be seen here: <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.instagram.com/p/C3Ny89uoTmK/">Issue 30</a>, <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cz1OQLtIxML/">Issue 29</a></li>
		<li>This position falls under the supervision of the Art Director.</li>

		</ul>

		<p><b>Desired Qualities:</b></p>
		<ul>
		<li>Timeliness and proactiveness. Work is especially important around the few weeks preceding release dates for our quarterly production cycle and can be more low-key in the weeks prior to the production of the next magazine issue.</li>
		<li>Open and effective communication.</li>
		<li>Attention to detail.</li>
		<li>Cooperative mindset.</li>
		<li>Background in graphic design.</li>
		<li><u><b>Proficiency</b> in Adobe Creative Suite with emphasis on <b>InDesign</b>.</u></li>

		<p>Applications will be considered until <b><i>March 17, 2024</i> on a rolling basis</b>. Each position requires a commitment of a <u>minimum 3 month period</u>.</p> 

		<p>Each position has the potential to become permanent, i.e. upgraded from the “intern”-level to a full staff role if editors are satisfied with interns’ attitude and performance. There is also a possibility that the intern position may be renewed for further 3-month periods.</p>

		<p>Applicants should send an email to <a href = "mailto:sinethetamag@gmail.com">sinethetamag@gmail.com</a> with a <b>brief cover letter in the body of the email</b> (we recommend 300-500 words as a non-binding guideline) indicating: 1) the position you are applying for, 2) any relevant past experience to the role you would like to include, and 3) your personal reasons and motivations for applying to the position.</p>

		<b>Supplemental materials:</b>

		<ul>
			<li><b>Print design interns:</b> please provide us with one or more samples of your previous graphic design work. You <i>do not</i> need a formal portfolio/portfolio site to apply; any graphic/print design-related samples of your work are helpful. You also do not need any formal design education to apply; we are happy to review applications from self-taught designers. Once you have applied, we will also send you a short <b>design exercise</b> as part of the application process. </li> 

		</ul>

		<p>All applications will receive acknowledgement of receipt. If your application has not been acknowledged by 3 days after applications close, it might have gone to spam: please send a separate email enquiry, and if that goes unacknowledged, please contact us on social media.</p>

		<p>Applicants who pass the first round of applications will be invited to <b>interview</b> with one or more members of the editorial board who are familiar with the position’s responsibilities.</p>

		<p>Sino creators <b><u>worldwide</u></b> with experience relevant to the open positions are encouraged to apply. <u>We are especially excited to work with creatives who are based outside of the United States</u>.</p>

		<p>We look forward to receiving your applications and welcoming you into the Sine Theta family!</p>
