			<p>Image: Still from 春光乍洩 / <i>Happy Together</i> (1997) directed by Wong Kar-wai. The shot is a close-up inside a dark room: a man, played by Tony Leung Chiu-wai, bends low to examine a cylindrical lamp depicting a waterfall. The glow of the lamp illuminates the waterfall image, creating a glittering effect among the brown, yellow, white, and turquoise hues, and casting a dim light into the man’s sorrowful expression. </p>
