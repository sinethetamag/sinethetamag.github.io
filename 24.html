		<p>烟炎张天。。。smoke spreads across the sky; a choking, oppressive sensation.</p>

		<p>Submissions to Sine Theta Magazine's 24th issue, themed “EMBER 炎” are officially open! Thanks to our Patreon subscribers, Sine Theta Magazine is a paying publication—all contributors will be paid $10 USD per piece.</p>

		<p>The sun has not set in days. The sky, the color of a forest fire. The clouds are inflamed, heavy with the truth. You are parched and breaking into a sweat. You are always breaking into a sweat.</p> 

		<p>“EMBER 炎” seeks works that consider the second law of thermodynamics—that entropy always increases with time. We want works that are disordered, that collapse into themselves; works whose atoms rearrange to birth different meanings, possibilities, narratives... We ask for works that show us exactly what it feels like to be alive in a burning world—the unbearable excruciation and exhilaration of it all.</p>  

		<p>Submissions are due <b>FRIDAY, JUNE 24, at 11:59 PM PDT</b> to <a href = "mailto:sinethetamag@gmail.com">sinethetamag@gmail.com</a> for full consideration of your work(s). Visit <a href = "submit.html">sinetheta.net/submit</a> for submissions guidelines. Feel free to DM or email us with any questions you may have; we welcome pitches sent ahead of the deadline!</p>

		<p>Submittors may wish to consider the following prompts:</p> 

		<p>heat death of the universe - dying stars - cold stars / mushroom clouds / trials by fire / fire as destruction - arson - xiamen dada burning their art in november 1986 / fire as rebirth - rising from ashes - phoenixes - fenghuang - gods of fire / campfire horror stories - folk tales - urban legends - rumor - gossip / passion / slash and burn agriculture - land rights and land dispossession - land and landscape as alive - indentured labor - forms of unfree labor / mars (火星) - the color red / small pockets of warmth / “the city of ember” by jeanne duprau / where there's smoke there's fire - smoke signals / lantern festival</p>
