		<p>Sine Theta Magazine is looking to expand its editorial team!</p>
		<p><i>Please note that all of these roles are volunteer</i> — at this time, none of the magazine’s staff are paid. These roles are not meant to substitute a full-time, paid job. All levels of staff work unpaid on the magazine as a passion project alongside their other responsibilities. Nonetheless, applicants will ideally seek to prioritise Sine Theta as a passion project.</p>
		<p>We are looking for:</p>
		<h5><b>Web content intern</b></h5>
		<p><b>Duties include:</b></p>

		<ul>
			<li>Solicit and create weekly features of artists and writers on Instagram and Twitter.</li>
			<li>Provide content-writing and event production support to the Web Editor and other members of Sine Theta staff as needed.</li>
			<li>Supporting the development, planning and execution of our annual Patreon drive.</li>
			<li>Help manage social media accounts.</li>


		</ul>

		<p><b>Desired Qualities:</b></p>

		<ul>
			<li>Timeliness and proactiveness. We estimate that this role will take up to a few hours of your time per week, with opportunities to get more involved with the magazine at your discretion.</li>
			<li>Open and effective communication and strong writing skills, with an emphasis on copywriting.</li>
			<li>Skill with social media, including but not limited to Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Discord, and Medium.</li>
			<li>Willingness to both learn and offer original ideas.</li>
			<li>Fluency in English is mandatory.</li>
			<li>Knowledge of and translation skills in Chinese is a plus but not at all required.</li> 
		</ul>

		<p>Applications will be considered until <b><u>April 5, 2022</u> on a rolling basis</b>. Each position requires a commitment of a <u>minimum 3 month period.</u></p> 

		<p>Each position has the potential to become permanent, or upgraded from the “intern”-level to a full staff role if editors are satisfied with interns’ attitude and performance. There is also a possibility that the intern position may be renewed beyond the minimum 3 month period.</p>

		<p>Applicants should send an email to <a href = "mailto:sinethetamag@gmail.com">sinethatmag@gmail.com</a> with a <b>brief cover letter in the body of the email</b> (we recommend 300-500 words as a non-binding guideline) indicating 1) the position you are applying for, 2) any relevant past experience to the role you would like to include, and 3) your personal reasons and motivations for applying to the position.</p>

		<p>Additionally, <b>please provide us with two sample written posts</b> about any Sino creative or piece of Sino-created art of your choosing, in the style of our Instagram and/or Twitter features (feel free to look at them first: <a target = _blank href = "https://www.instagram.com/sinethetamag/">IG</a> / <a target = _blank href = "https://twitter.com/sinethetamag">Twitter</a>). Your posts should indicate an awareness and knowledge of effective communication and audience optimization on the social medium you choose. <b>Please attach this as a separate Word document to your email;</b> include the associated images with the “Instagram post/Twitter thread” in the Word doc in addition to the text that accompanies the post.</p>

		<p>All applications will receive acknowledgement of receipt. If your application has not been acknowledged by 3 days after applications close, it might have gone to spam: please send a separate email enquiry, and if that goes unacknowledged, please contact us on social media.</p>

		<p>Applicants who pass the first round of applications will be invited to interview with one or more members of the editorial board who are familiar with the position’s responsibilities.</p>

		<p>Sino creators <b><u>worldwide</u></b> with experience relevant to the open positions are encouraged to apply. <u>We are especially excited to work with creatives who are based outside of the United States.</u></p>

		<p>We look forward to receiving your applications and welcoming you into the Sine Theta family!</p>
