		<p>Sine Theta Magazine is looking to expand its staff!</p>

		<p><i>Please note that all of these roles are volunteer</i> — at this time, none of the magazine’s staff are paid. These roles are not meant to substitute paid jobs. All of our staff work unpaid on the magazine as a passion project alongside their other responsibilities. Nonetheless, applicants will ideally seek to prioritize Sine Theta as an important commitment.</p>

		<p>Applications will be considered until <b><i>September 20, 2024</i> on a rolling basis</b>. Each position requires a commitment of a <u>minimum 3 month period</u>.</p> 

		<p>Each position has the potential to become permanent, i.e. upgraded from the probationary “intern”-level to a full staff role if editors are satisfied with interns’ attitude and performance. There is also a possibility that the intern position may be renewed for further 3-month periods.</p>

		<p>Applicants should email <a href = "mailto:sinethetamag@gmail.com">sinethetamag@gmail.com</a> with a <b>brief cover letter in the body of the email</b> (we recommend 300-500 words as a non-binding guideline) indicating: 1) the position you are applying for, 2) any relevant past experience to the role you would like to include, and 3) your personal reasons and motivations for applying to the position. </p>

		<h5 style ="margin-top:3%">Supplemental materials:</h5>

		<ul>
			<li style ="margin-top:3%"><b>Web content interns:</b> please provide us with <b>two sample written posts</b> about any Sino creative or piece of Sino-created art or writing of your choosing, <b>in the style of our Instagram features</b> (please familiarize yourself with them first: <a target="_blank" href = "http://instagram.com/sinethetamag">instagram.com/sinethetamag</a>). Your posts should indicate an awareness and knowledge of effective communication and audience optimization on Instagram. Please attach this as a separate <b>Word document</b> to your email; include any associated images with the “Instagram post” in the Word doc alongside the caption text.</li> 
			<li style="margin-top:3%;margin-bottom: 3%"><b>Web/publicity interns:</b> Provide brief answers (100 words or less) to the following prompts: <b>1) Explain why Sine Theta should receive a grant funding opportunity to support our work; 2) propose a project that Sine Theta could undertake using grant funding.</b></li> 

		</ul>

		<p>Where suitable, web content intern applicants will also be considered for web/publicity intern roles, and vice versa. </p>

		<p>All applications will receive acknowledgement of receipt. If your application has not been acknowledged by 3 days after the deadline, it might have gone to spam: please send a separate email enquiry, and if that goes unacknowledged, please contact us on social media. </p>

		<p>Applicants who pass the first round of applications will be invited to <b>interview</b> with one or more members of the editorial board who are familiar with the position’s responsibilities.</p>

		<p>Sino creators <b><u>worldwide</u></b> with interest relevant to the open positions are encouraged to apply. <u>We are especially excited to work with creatives who are based outside the United States.</u></p>

		<p>We look forward to receiving your applications and welcoming you into the Sine Theta family!</p>
