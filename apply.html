		<p>Sine Theta Magazine is looking to expand its editorial team!</p>
		<p><i>Please note that all of these roles are volunteer</i> — at this time, none of the magazine’s staff are paid. These roles are not meant to substitute a full-time, paid job. All levels of staff work unpaid on the magazine as a passion project while doing other things.</p>
		<p>To keep pace with the growth of our publication, we are looking for:</p>
		<p><b>Web content intern</b></p>
		<p><b>Duties include:</b></p>

		<ul>
			<li>Solicit and create weekly features of artists and writers on Instagram and Twitter.</li>
			<li>Provide content-writing and event production support to the Web Editor and other members of Sine Theta staff as needed.</li>
			<li>Help manage social media accounts.</li>


		</ul>

		<p><b>Desired Qualities:</b></p>

		<ul>
			<li>Open and effective communication and strong writing skills.</li>
			<li>Skill with social media, including but not limited to Tumblr, Instagram, Facebook, and Medium.</li>
			<li>Timeliness and proactiveness.</li>
			<li>Willingness to both learn and offer original ideas.</li>
			<li>Fluency in English is mandatory.</li>
			<li>Knowledge of and translation skills of the Chinese language is a plus.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><b>Print design intern</b></p>

		<p><b>Duties include:</b></p>

		<ul>
			<li>Provide graphic design support to the Art Director and design staff as needed for promotional material (e.g. posters, social media graphics, etc.)</li>
			<li>Use Adobe InDesign (and other supplemental Adobe Suite software as needed) to participate in the design process of each quarterly print issue, laying out pages in creative ways that reflect the spirit and ‘vibe’ of short stories, poetry, and nonfiction features included in the magazine</li>
			<li>Help brainstorm and potentially help create merch items</li>

		</ul>

		<p><b>Desired Qualities:</b></p>
		<ul>

			<li>Open and effective communication.</li>
			<li>Attention to detail.</li>
			<li>Timeliness and proactiveness.</li>
			<li>Cooperative mindset.</li>
			<li>Background in graphic design.</li>
			<li><u><b>Proficiency</b> in Adobe Creative Suite with emphasis on <b>Indesign.</b></u></li> 
		</ul>

		<p>Applications will be considered until <b><i>January 22, 2021</i> on a rolling basis.</b> Each position requires a commitment of a <u>minimum 3 month period.</u></p> 

		<p>Each position has the potential to become permanent/upgraded from “intern”-hood to a full staff role if editors are impressed with interns’ attitude and performance.</p>

		<p>Applicants should send an email to <a href = mailto:sinethetamag@gmail.com>sinethetamag@gmail.com</a> with a brief <b>cover letter in the body of the email</b> indicating 1) the position you are applying for, 2) any relevant past experience to the role you would like to include, and 3) your personal reasons and motivations for applying to the position. Additionally,</a>

		<ul>

			<li>If you are applying for the <b>Web content intern</b> position, please provide us with two sample written posts about any Sino creative or piece of art from a Sino creative art of your choosing, in the style of our Instagram features. Your posts should indicate an awareness and knowledge of effective communication and audience optimization on the social medium you choose. Please attach this as a separate word document to your email; include the associated images with the “Instagram post” in the word doc in addition to the text that accompanies the post.</li>
			<li>If you are applying for the <b>Print design intern</b> position, please provide us with one or more samples of your previous graphic design work. You do not need a formal portfolio/portfolio site to apply; any several print design-related samples of your work are helpful. You also do not need any formal design education to apply; we are happy to review applications from self-taught designers. Once you have applied, we will also send you a design exercise as part of the application process.</li> 
		</ul>

		<p>Sino creators <b>worldwide</b> with experience relevant to the open positions are encouraged to apply. We are especially excited to work with creatives who are based outside of the United States. Applications for multiple positions are welcome. We also understand that this is a fraught and difficult time, so we are open to any requests for additional support or extensions to the posted deadline, as well as to answer any questions that you may have about the magazine or the application process via our email.</p>

		<p>We look forward to receiving your applications and growing our Sine Theta family!</p>
