		<p>匿名揭帖。。。a notice written under a false name; a public note under pseudonym.</p>

		<p>Submissions to Sine Theta Magazine's 23nd issue, themed “NOTES 帖” are officially open! Thanks to our Patreon subscribers, Sine Theta Magazine is a paying publication - all contributors will be paid $10 USD per piece. Read our <a href = "submit.html">submission guidelines</ for more details.</p>


		<p>Take a leaf out of someone's book. They've left a message for you. It says to meet them by the bridge you once loved a few universes over. But once you get to the bridge, there's no sign of them...... no sign at all, except a small tag on the side of a wall with a date which brings on memories upon memories.</p> 


		<p>"NOTES 帖" calls for works created on the backs of receipts and conceived while in motion. We love the additive quality of a note: the underlined quote to a work which made you cry, the quick love letter next to a morning coffee, the gentle reminder of what's been weighing on your mind, realised. Send us the tiny messages you slip into your friends' pockets. Show us what it means to 'take note'.</p>


		<p>Submissions are due <b>MONDAY, MARCH 28, 11:59 PM PDT</b> to <a href = "mailto:sinethetamag@gmail.com">sinethetamag@gmail.com</a> for full consideration of your work(s). Visit our <a href = "submit.html">submissions guidelines</a> for more details. Feel free to DM or email us with any questions you may have; we welcome pitches ahead of time!</p>


		<p>Submitters may wish to consider the following prompts:</p> 



		<p>ephemera - trash - pocket lint - things kicked under the bed and couch - non-bookmark objects used as bookmarks / internet litter - ads - spam - pop-ups - fake accounts - abandoned accounts /bell hooks' choosing the margin as a space of radical openness /  the archival impulse - archives as death - archives as life - the body in the archive / graffiti - vandalism - détournement art - appropriation and repetition - citation as political / reminders - amnesia - involuntary memory / the notes app / reading someone else’s diary / notes of a crocodile by qiu miaojin</p>
