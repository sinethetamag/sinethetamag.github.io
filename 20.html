		<p>Submissions to Sine Theta Magazine's 20th issue, themed “EVENING 暮”, are officially open! Thanks to our Patreon subscribers, Sine Theta Magazine is a paying publication - all contributors will be paid $10 USD per piece. Read our submission guidelines for more details.</p>


		<p>We want artwork with all the colours of the evening sky. Works which depict things in decline – people, empires, institutions – and relishes in its dying light. What comes creeping in at the eve of a story, when the borders between one world and another are thinnest? Who lingers; who stays; who departs swiftly early on, with decisiveness? This issue asks for submissions which defers and alters a set path, knows when to let threads of a narrative blurs out, and likes to speculate on the speculative. Give us a story of your in-betweens, your out-of-office hours, your well-constructed half-baked thoughts.</p>


		<p>Submissions are due <b>WEDNESDAY, JULY 7, 11:59 PM PDT</b> to <a href = "mailto:sinethetamag@gmail.com">sinethetamag@gmail.com</a> for full consideration of your work(s). For more information on how to submit, please visit our <a href = "submit.html">submission guidelines</a>. Feel free to DM or email us with any questions you may have; we welcome pitches ahead of time!</p>

		<p>Verbal prompts:</p>

		<p>end of one world and start of another / crossing realms, crossing worlds - demolishing borders - passersby and passing through - membranes - porousness / queering / unexpected developments - alternative comings of age / multiverse theory - parallel universes - non-linear timelines / the things that come out at night - creatures and plants that are nocturnal</p>
