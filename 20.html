		<p>Rounding off our series of issues dedicated to the turning of the day, sinθ #20 “EVENING 暮” brings us works which defers and alters a set path. Evening is a greeting and a farewell, a time of rest and play, a brief period of freedom between the labor of the day and night’s call for sleep.</p>

		<p>Also featured in this issue are the winners of our Summer Writing Contest, now in its third iteration. We are especially grateful to our Rebecca F. Kuang and Chen Chen for serving as judges for our fiction and prose judges respectively this year.</p>
