		<h5>HOW TO SUBMIT:</h5> 

		<p><b>Please email all submissions to sinethetamag@gmail.com. Please format your document title as "NAME - Title [or description, eg Untitled photo essay or 3 poems]".</b></p>

		<p>The Sino diaspora is defined as the people of Chinese, Taiwanese, Hong Kong, or Macau heritage, who live anywhere away from the original 'homeland' of that heritage. Everyone with Sino ancestry is welcome to contribute to Sine Theta magazine!</p>

		<p>Knowledge of Chinese is not necessary to submit. Sine Theta magazine is an English-language publication accessible to all, with a Chinese glossary printed in every issue.</p>

		<p>Please fill and include the following <b>submission form</b> in the body of your email:</p>
		<div style = "margin-bottom:5%;background-color:#f8f8f8" class = "mx auto col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-lg-8 col-xl-8"> 
		<ul>
			<li><b>Name (as you wish to be credited):</b></li> 
			<li><b>Chinese name (if possible):</b></li>
			<li><b>Third-person bio (up to 80 words):</b></li>

			<li><b>Do you identify as a member of the Sino diaspora?:</b> YES/NO </li>
		</ul>
		</div>

		<h5>WHAT TO SUBMIT</h5>
		<p>We accept all genres of visual and literary work as long as they relate to the current theme. Works do not necessarily have to pertain to the diasporic experience.</p> 

		<p>Examples of work that we accept include: poetry, fiction, creative non-fiction, photo essays, theoretical essays, individual works of art (paintings, drawings, photography, sculpture, etc), visual or hybrid projects (including installations), comics, one-act plays or screenplays, etc. We are also open to pitches for serialized narratives. Please note that, as we are a quarterly publication, we do not accept news reporting and current-affairs articles. Longform feature reporting or evergreen articles are welcome.</p>

		<p>Multiple submissions are encouraged (as long as all submitted works are relevant) as they allow us to choose from a selection and better curate the issue as a whole.</p>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Poetry:</b> Please submit no more than 5 poems per submission.</li>
		<li><b>Prose:</b> There is no word limit on prose submissions, but please keep in mind that the prose pieces we publish in our magazine often range between 1500-2000 words. You may pitch a prose piece without a first draft; please do so as early as possible.</li>
		<li><b>Visual art:</b> Please submit no more than 10 individual works of art per submission.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>We will not publish work that has already appeared in another publication. Simultaneous submissions are welcome, so long as they are classified as such and we are informed promptly if they are accepted elsewhere.</p>

		<p>Upon publication in Sine Theta, publication rights of a work revert to its contributor. <b>Any subsequent publications must acknowledge us</b>, i.e. "first published in Sine Theta Magazine."</p>

		<p>Written work should be in PDF, Microsoft Word, or Google Docs format. If a piece is submitted as a Google Doc, please allow editing or commenting rights â€” not view only. Visual work should be submitted as high-quality scans or well-cropped photography with no shadows.</p>

		<h5>WHEN TO SUBMIT</h5>
		<p>We publish quarterly print issues. Deadlines are generally around 6 weeks before publication. Please follow us on social media to stay updated.</p> 

		<p>Please allow around 2 weeks for deliberation. We will notify you of editorial decisions after this time.</p>

		<h5>BECOMING A CONTRIBUTOR</h5>
		<p>All contributors whose works have appeared in an issue are eligible to receive a free PDF copy, which is for your own records and not expected to be circulated; and will be featured on our website. Due to financial constraints, we cannot offer free print editions. We hope that this situation improves in the future as Sine Theta expands, and but as a small independent magazine, this is currently not a viable option for us.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, Sine Theta magazine is currently unable to financially compensate contributors. However, you will receive our eternal gratitude and love, and we will buy you a drink if we meet up!</p>

		<p>If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us via email!</p>
