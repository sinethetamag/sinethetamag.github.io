	<p>SINθ MAGAZINE ISSUE #12 “THUNDER 雷” IS OUT NOW!</p> 

	<p>"Are the fish truly trapped in the pond? The minute they meet the storm, they become dragons." -Qian Cai (Story of Yue Fei)</p>

	<p>This sunny, sweltering summer day (with summer rain in some parts of the world), marks the release of Issue #12 “THUNDER 雷”! In between the featured interview with Jessica J. Lee and our second Student Spotlight, Lucy Li Chenhui, this issue is packed with poetry, narratives, photography and visual art from Sino creatives all over the world.</p>

	<p>“THUNDER 雷” includes Erin Jin Mei O’Malley and K-Ming Chang’s winning entries from our first summer writing competition judged by Nancy Huang and Sharlene Teo. Thank you to everyone who participated in our writing contest and our book giveaway, and for visiting us during our Toronto launch at our new stockist, Tea Base! Moving onwards, find us at the Asian American Literature Festival at Eaton House DC on August 4! More information about the festival can be found <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.facebook.com/events/2833524910055209/">here.</a></p>

	<p>We hope that the works in this issue will give you a sense of the creators’ experiences with shock, panic, suffocation, rage and fury. Perhaps they could even bring you closer to the gods and forces of thunder. May this issue strike you as hard as it did for us!</p>

	<p>The full version of Lucy Li Chenhui's interview will be posted on <a target = "_blank" href = "https://medium.com/@sinethetamag">Medium</a>.

	<p>Front and back cover featuring works by Kimberly Kiong.</p>
