	<p>SINθ MAGAZINE ISSUE #12 “THUNDER 雷” IS OUT NOW!</p> 

	<p>"Are the fish truly trapped in the pond? The minute they meet the storm, they become dragons." -Qian Cai (Story of Yue Fei)</p>

	<p>Thank you to everyone who participated in our <a href = contest2019.html>writing contest</a> and our book giveaway, and for visiting us during our Toronto launch at our new stockist, Tea Base! Moving onwards, find us at the Asian American Literature Festival at Eaton House DC on August 4! More information about the festival can be found here.</p>

	<p>We hope that the works in this issue will give you a sense of the creators’ experiences with shock, panic, suffocation, rage and fury. Perhaps they could even bring you closer to the gods and forces of thunder. May this issue strike you as hard as it did for us!</p>
