		<p>A single plastic bag drifts aimlessly toward the horizon. Not a soul in sight. The smell of rust and decay wafts through the air. Dust clings to your shoes as you make your way through the debris. For sinθ #34 “WASTELAND 荒”, we call you to explore the complexities of our relationship with nature. Wade through ruins of the past and present, across new art, writing, and conversations. Contemplate what the future will or should look like.</p>
