	<p>Our upcoming <a href = "12.html">Issue #12 “THUNDER (雷)”</a> marks three years of Sine Theta! To celebrate, we invite you to participate in our first-ever summer writing competition! We are delighted to welcome back previously featured writers Nancy Huang (poetry, author of Favorite Daughter) and Sharlene Teo (prose, author of Ponti) as judges.</p> 
	<p><b>Submit by July 15th for</b> a chance to be published in Issue #12 and receive feedback from established writers! First place in each category will receive a $50 cash prize. </p>

	<p>We’re accepting entries for both prose (fiction) and poetry. We invite you to reflect on the following three quotes as inspiration for your pieces. You may reflect on the quotes separately or as a collective, drawing themes and ideas that resonate with you. Entries must engage with the prompt(s), but can do so either directly or indirectly. <b>You may only submit one entry per category, so send us your best work!</b></p>
