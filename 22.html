		<p>You wake as a butterfly as a person as a butterfly. What are you: a butterfly dream of a person, or the personified mode of a butterfly? Zhuangzi’s story reflects on the false dichotomy between dream-space and reality-space, and suggests that to abolish these distinctions is what it means to be lucid. The works of sinθ #22 “LUCID 醒” move through similar thematics: what it means to be conscious, to be aware—whether being lucid is a possibility at all, given the fragmented realities we inhabit and move between.</p>

		<p>In this issue:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Gracing our front cover and multiple spreads in sinθ #22 is multidisciplinary artist Erica Zhang’s glowing, luscious 3D media works; Six Kilometers’ vibrant portrait, “Admonitions of the stars 星星的諫言” features on our back cover</li>
			<li>Editor Laetitia Keok interviews poet Yanyi; they discuss the process of writing his second book, Dream of the Divided Field, and what it means to exercise radical honesty and presentness in creative work through grief</li>
			<li>With great energy, KAFEI’s pencil sketches depict everyday scenes from the lives of the rebellious and eccentric; Anson Li’s “Daffodil” is a dreamy, fantasy driven work in graphite and coloured pencil</li>
			<li>Print Designer Miki Wong chats with architect-turned-interdisciplinary artist Chong Yan Chuah, who speaks about his interest in the complex relations between human identity and the virtual realm, the Malaysian art scene and developing practice</li>
			<li>Alan Dai’s short story, “Snake Huntin’ is Serious Business”, is a hallucinatory, surreal read on sleep deprivation and medication</li>
			<li>Editor Eli Hsieh speaks to writer Lan Samantha Chang on her most recent book, The Family Chao, the idea of gastronomical desire, and intergenerational loss</li>
			<li>In “On Entomophagy”, Juliette Wu works through the commercialisation of eating insects in the United States, its roots in Asian cuisine, and food colonialism</li>
			<li>Editor-in-chief Jiaqi Kang features Jess Routley for our Student Spotlight; they discuss Routley’s developing practice, experiences in art school, and community building</li>
