	 <ol>
	 	<li style = "margin-bottom:10px">Write something loud.</li>
		<li style = "margin-bottom:10px">
			<p>“Sound, like light, is energy comprised of waves, a series of perceived reflections and refractions that orient us in time and space. <b>Sound reflects our relation to other bodies and objects</b>. This sonic data is central to a poetic strategy that I call “decolonial echolocation”—a method of bodily knowing, a somatosensory epistemology of embodied navigation of coloniality for those who were not meant to survive. It is the <b>diasporic physiological process of sensing distant or invisible objects</b> by sound waves emitted back to the emitter, to draw on the dictionary definition of echolocation.”</p> 
			<p>——Tao Leigh Goffe, “<a target = "_blank" href = "http://archipelagosjournal.org/assets/issue05/goffe-unmapping.pdf">Unmapping the Caribbean: Toward a Digital Praxis of Archipelagic Sounding</a>,” <i>archipelagos</i> (December 2020)</p>
		</li>
		<li style = "margin-bottom:10px">
			<p>“Inside Sparrow, sounds accumulated. Bells, birds and the uneven cracking of trees, loud and quiet insects, ones that spilled from people even if they never intended to make a noise. […] Sound had a freedom that no thought could equal because sound made no absolute claim on meaning.”</p> 
			<p>——Madeleine Thien, <i>Do Not Say We Have Nothing</i> (2016)</p>
