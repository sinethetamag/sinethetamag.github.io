			<p>“Image: Still from <i>过春天 / The Crossing</i> (2018) dir. Bai Xue. Through a window, a girl in school uniform sits at a restaurant table, eating. She is the only figure visible inside the restaurant. Visible in the window reflection there is a man standing on the street, smoking and looking into the distance. Behind this man, also in the reflection, there is a red car indicating street traffic.</p>

			<p>“I relaxed my grip on the seed momentarily and then squeezed it more tightly than ever in the firm grip of my winding coils. The yellow flesh sweated, effused scent. In my tight grip, something inside the seed seemed to stir. I felt a slight, momentary vibration. Though I held the heart of the fruit, the fruit held me. Its strange acids worked at my flesh in a way that discomfited me. I found a small hole in the seed. I scaled further down and crawled inside. I became the seed and the seed became me. Whatever grows from it will be mine.”</p>
