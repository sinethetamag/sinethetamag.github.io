		<p>After the storm, the morning grass is fresh, green. Mist rises. You spray perfume on the inside of your wrist. Somewhere, a fire is sizzling. The last in our five-senses series is “AROMA 馝”, an issue unraveling scent in all its pleasant and odious manifestations. What captures your nose?</p>

		<p>This issue features the winners of our <a href = "contest.html">sixth annual writing contest</a>, as well as a selection from the shortlist; keep an eye out for other shortlisted works in <i>sinθ #33</i>.
