		<p>望秋先零。。。To wither in the face of fall; with the feebleness of old age while still in youth.</p>

		<p>Submissions to Sine Theta Magazine's 25th issue, themed “ZERO 零” are officially open! Thanks to our Patreon subscribers, Sine Theta Magazine is a paying publication—all contributors will be paid $10 USD per piece.</p>

		<p>Zero is the cardinality of an empty set; that is, the number of its elements. It is not nothing–nothing is nothing–and yet it can represent nothingness. A resting point. Half of a totality.</p>

		<p>“ZERO 零" asks for works in which nothing much happens. What if rest was a kind of completion? Write about that. We want pieces which imagine the wasteland as a site of plenty, or oblivion as a kind of gentle embrace. Give us your best critique of binary code, your ability to recognsie absence where there should be presence, your thoughts on the null set... there is so much within nothing. Tell us about it.</p>

		<p>Submissions are due <b>TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, at 11:59 PM PDT</b> to <a href = "mailto:sinethetamag@gmail.com">sinethetamag@gmail.com</a> for full consideration of your work(s). Visit our <a href = "submit.html">submissions guidelines</a> for more details. Feel free to DM or email us with any questions you may have; we welcome pitches sent ahead of the deadline!</p>

		<p>Submittors may wish to consider the following prompts:</p> 

		<p>mathematics - paradoxes - algorithms - alternative knowledge systems and epistemologies / freezing temperatures - winter - snowscapes / wasteland - barrenness - bounty - plenty - land use - land rights - political landscapes - indigeneity - the intimacies of four continents (2015) by lisa lowe - entangled histories - definitions and practices of solidarity - police and prison abolition  / oblivion / black holes / circles and ovals - eggs - planets - pearls - olives - dates / ouroboros - infinity / mouths - orifices - entrances and exits</p>
