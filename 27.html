		<p>Join us in celebrating community and connection, the relationships that shape all of us into who we are. Swim in the rivers of your childhood memories. Ponder companionship and collectivism and interconnected threads, a head resting against a shoulder. “FRIEND 朋” is a tapestry documenting the seasons of friendship: the initial spark and the ending fizzle and the tender moments that fall in the middle.</p>
