		<p>三朋四友。。。Friendships of all kinds, tree branches reaching for one another.</p>

		<p>Submissions to Sine Theta Magazine's 27th issue, themed “FRIEND 朋” are officially open! Thanks to our Patreon subscribers, Sine Theta Magazine is a paying publication—all contributors will be paid $10 USD per piece.</p>

		<p>In “FRIEND 朋,” we want to weave a tapestry documenting the seasons of friendship: the initial spark and the ending fizzle and the tender moments that fall in-between. We want to celebrate community and connection. Swim in the rivers of your childhood memories. Ponder companionship and blood feuds, family gatherings and secret networks, all-consuming crushes and adolescent jealousies. Pull apart the relationships that shape all of us into who we are. Collaborative works are highly encouraged.</p> 

		<p>Submissions are due <b>SUNDAY, 26 MARCH, at 11:59 PM PST</b> to <a href = "mailto:sinethetamag@gmail.com">sinethetamag@gmail.com</a> for full consideration of your work(s). Visit our <a href = "submit.html">submissions guidelines</a> for more information. Feel free to DM or email us with any questions you may have; we welcome pitches sent ahead of the deadline!</p>
