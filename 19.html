		<p>旁午走急。。。to rush to a place from every direction; numerous interlacings, complex situations.</p> 

		<p>Submissions to Sine Theta Magazine's 19th issue, themed “HIGH NOON 午”, are officially open! Thanks to our Patreon subscribers, Sine Theta Magazine is now a paying publication - all contributors will be paid $10 USD. Read our submission guidelines for more details.</p>

		<p>We want works set under a scorching sun. Art with the drama of a Western stand-off, ready to meet us at its centre. Tell us a story about confrontation. Maybe it's a space opera set on the cusp of abolition, or a personal encounter which cuts straight into the heart of the matter. Will you make a work that opens from multiple positions, then hones in on a center? This issue asks for submissions with heat and blazing light; pieces which capture the apex of a moment, as well as the cycles they are woven into.</p>

		<p>Submissions are due <b>MONDAY, APRIL 5, 11:59 PM PDT</b> to <a href = "mailto:sinethetamag@gmail.com">sinethetamag@gmail.com</a> for full consideration of your work(s). Visit our <a href = "http://sinetheta.net/submit">submissions guidelines</a> for more details. Feel free to DM or email us with any questions you may have; we welcome pitches ahead of time!</p>
