		<p>The Sino diaspora is one of the largest diasporas on the planet. Our mission is to foster community around the creative voices and works of Sino writers and artists, and to create a platform highlighting the concept of diaspora as one that challenges national borders and subverts hierarchies. We are committed to print culture and the materiality of the physical publication. In addition to our print magazine, we host and attend events that connect Sino creatives and other community members across the globe, and spotlight writers and artists from the diaspora on our social media pages. </p>

		<p>Sino diasporas are defined as people of ‘Chinese’ background who have some kind of relationship ‘away’ from that background. These ideas are defined as broadly as possible and are rooted in self-determination. This can include people with backgrounds from mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and the broader Sinosphere—a cultural-linguistic space transcending national boundaries, where Mandarin, Cantonese, Hokkien, and other Sinitic languages anchor shared and contested identities. We use the word ‘Sino’ because it is expansive, flexible, and encompasses tensions as well as contradictions of identity.  </p>
