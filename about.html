		<p>sinθ (Sine Theta) is an international print creative arts magazine that connects and empowers members of the Sino diaspora like ourselves. We take submissions of visual art and literature and feature interviews with established and rising creators alike in the magazine.</p>

		<p>The Sino diaspora is one of the largest diasporas on the planet. Our mission is to create a platform that highlights the concept of diaspora as one that challenges traditional conceptions of borders while celebrating the creative voices and works of talented Sino visual artists and writers. In addition to our quarterly print magazine, we regularly host online events that connect Sino creatives and other community members across the globe, and we also often feature writers and artists from the diaspora on our social media pages.</p>

		<p>Contributing writers and magazine staff have gone on to be featured in and recognized by the Poetry Foundation, Best of the Net, The Best American Poetry, Asian American Writers Workshop, Lambda Literary Award, Pushcart Prize, the Massachusetts Review, Tin House, The White Review, The New Poets Prize, One World/Random House, BOAAT, The Offing, Poetry Society of the U.K., Wigleaf Top 50, The Shirley Jackson Awards, Tor.com, Southbank Centre, and more. Our visual art contributors have gone on to be featured in and recognized by the Met, Los Angeles Magazine, MoMA PS1, C33 Gallery, Et Al Gallery, Centre Never Apart, Plain Magazine, Tunis International Feminist Art Festival, the Paris Review, and more.</p>

		<p>Since 2016, sinθ has interviewed creatives from the Sino diaspora across a wide spectrum of creative disciplines, ranging across music, visual art, culinary arts, community-based projects, poetry and literature, technology and design, and research.
