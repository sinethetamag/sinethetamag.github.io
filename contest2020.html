	<p>To celebrate another year of Sine Theta, we are bringing back our summer writing competition for its second iteration...</p> 

	<p>We are delighted to announce K-Ming Chang (author of BESTIARY, forthcoming in September 2020) and Sally Wen Mao (interviewed in Issue #15 "MAGIC 魔", author of OCULUS and MAD HONEY SYMPOSIUM) as our judges of prose and poetry, respectively.</p> 
	<p><b>Submit by July 31, 2020</b> for a chance to be published in Issue #16 and receive feedback from established writers! First place in each category will receive a $50 USD cash prize.</p>

	<p>We’re accepting entries for both prose (fiction) and poetry. We invite you to reflect on the following three prompts as inspiration for your pieces. You may reflect on the prompts separately or as a collective, drawing themes and ideas that resonate with you. Entries must engage with the prompt(s), but can do so either directly or indirectly. <b>You may only submit one entry per category, so send us your best work!</b></p>
