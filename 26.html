		<p>What does it mean to understand the world as infinitely changeable, the way a mushroom does? Might the fungus lead us to means of resistance and resilience, when there is so much operating against our survival? sinθ #26 “FUNGUS 菌" is a breeding ground of pieces that take up space between the cracks, creating networks with no beginning or end, eating the surface it holds together.</p> 
		<p>In this issue:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Managing Editor Chi S. Tsu attends Icelandic singer-songwriter Laufey’s London concert and <a href = "laufey.html">speaks to her about her experience as a genre-blending contemporary jazz artist</a>. </li>
		<li>Junior Editor Eli Hsieh talks to Malaysian travel and food writer Florentyna Leow about Leow’s essay collection, How Kyoto Breaks Your Heart.</li> 
		<li>For our Student Spotlight feature, Web Editor Hayley Wu gets to know UK-based poet Eric Yip; they talk through ideas of language, authenticity, and the value of taking your time.</li> 
		<li>Sean Wai Keung and Sydney Trieu deftly intertwine food with nostalgia in their writing, whilst Kate Ray walks us through a grounding meal-concert experience.</li> 
		<li>Staff Contributor C. Grace Chang and Taiwanese American multidisciplinary artist Vincent Chong discuss ideas of the body, perspective, and calligraphy, and how this influences their portraiture practice.</li> 
		<li>Aristotle X and Grace Kwan draw from folklore and anthropological theory respectively in their gentle poems.</li>
		<li>Fungus Amongus share their collective zine, grounded by ideas of mycelium networks.</li>  
		<li>Writing by Heather Qin and Carolyn Tung will startle and delight, exploring the limits of mortality and the apocalypse.</li>
		<li>Poetry by Kimberley Chia and Emily Lu Gao digs into decay and existence.</li>
		<li>Digital art by Jacelyn Yap and Juliette Wu takes us to realms of magic and surrealism; work by Ames Ma, Joy Wong, Jen Li, and Gigi Wong draws from the depths of the natural and material world we live in.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Front cover by Alice F. Wang.</p>
