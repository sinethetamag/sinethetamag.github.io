		<p>What does it mean to understand the world as infinitely changeable, the way a mushroom does? Might the fungus lead us to means of resistance and resilience, when there is so much operating against our survival? sinθ #26 “FUNGUS 菌" is a breeding ground of pieces that take up space between the cracks, creating networks with no beginning or end, eating the surface it holds together.</p> 
		<p>In this issue:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Managing Editor Lis Chi Siegel attends Icelandic singer-songwriter Laufey’s London concert and speaks to her about her experience as a genre-blending contemporary jazz artist. </li>
		<li>Junior Editor Eli Hsieh talks to Malaysian travel and food writer Florentyna Leow about Leow’s essay collection, How Kyoto Breaks Your Heart.</li> 
		<li>For our Student Spotlight feature, Web Editor Hayley Wu gets to know UK-based poet Eric Yip; they talk through ideas of language, authenticity, and the value of taking your time.</li> 
		<li>Sean Wai Keung and Sydney Trieu deftly intertwine food with nostalgia in their writing, whilst Kate Ray walks us through a grounding meal-concert experience.</li> 
		<li>Staff Contributor C. Grace Chang and Taiwanese American multidisciplinary artist Vincent Chong discuss ideas of the body, perspective, and calligraphy, and how this influences their portraiture practice.</li> 
		<li>Aristotle X and Grace Kwan draw from folklore and anthropological theory respectively in their gentle poems.</li>
		<li>Fungus Amongus share their collective zine, grounded by ideas of mycelium networks.</li>  
		<li>Writing by Heather Qin and Carolyn Tung will startle and delight, exploring the limits of mortality and the apocalypse.</li>
		<li>Poetry by Kimberley Chia and Emily Lu Gao digs into decay and existence.</li>
		<li>Digital art by Jacelyn Yap and Juliette Wu takes us to realms of magic and surrealism; work by Ames Ma, Joy Wong, Jen Li, and Gigi Wong draws from the depths of the natural and material world we live in.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>夏蟲朝菌。。。A fleeting existence; a momentary burst of life, from which death grows.</p>

		<p>Submissions to Sine Theta Magazine's 26th issue, themed “FUNGUS 菌” are officially open! Thanks to our Patreon subscribers, Sine Theta Magazine is a paying publication—all contributors will be paid $10 USD per piece.</p>

		<p>In The Mushroom at the End of the World, Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing writes:</p>

		<p>“Fungi are famous for changing shape in relation to their encounters and environments. Many are “potentially immortal”, meaning they die from disease, or lack of resources, but not from old age… we rarely imagine life without such limits—and when we do we stray into magic.”</p> 

		<p>“FUNGUS 菌" asks for works in which life and death are ever-reciprocal, ever-intertwined. Pieces that take up space between the cracks, creating networks with no beginning and end, eating the surface it holds together. What does it mean to understand the world as infinitely changeable, the way a mushroom does? Might the fungus lead us to means of resistance and resilience, when there is so much operating against our survival? Show us the contours of these paths.</p>
