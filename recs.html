	<p>Current healthcare measures for COVID-19 have escalated to lockdown and shelter-in-place mandates in many places in the world. For a lot of us, this is a time where we feel detached from our communities and loved ones - a moment that is uncertain, anxiety-inducing and traumatic.</p>

	<p>Although the arts can’t directly address our fears of failing healthcare systems, we might still find comfort in them; a power that has value. While stuck at home, the arts may be a reminder of what we love in the world, a way of being with others, and a way to imagine changing the contradictions of our societies.</p> 

	<p>For now, the <i>sinθ</i> team has put together a list of media that they’ve taken comfort in during these times - in the hopes that they too might bring comfort to anyone reading, watching, or listening.</p>

	<p>For book recommendations, we encourage you to support your local independent bookstores, many of whom are taking orders online or via phone! Mass shipping companies such as Amazon have flagrantly <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/4/1/21201162/amazon-delivery-delays-coronavirus-worker-strikes?">disregarded the health of their workers during the pandemic</a>; risking not only precarious workers but also our communities at large.

Equally at home in the world of good books and bad politics, Brooklyn-born rappers and Swiss novelists, she is by turns wry, heartfelt, indignant, and incisive - and never any less than perfect company in this work of literary journalism.</p>
